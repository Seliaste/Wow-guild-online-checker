# WoW Guild Online Checker for Discord  
This is a simple bot to check who is online in your World of Warcraft guild.  
Due to Blizzard's API limitations, this bot currently only shows when a character has last disconnected.  
Unfortunately, due to the time it takes to retrieve info, it can be a little laggy  
## How to run it  
First off, get your own discord bot on https://discord.com/developers/. Then, you have to get API access on Battle.net.  
Then, get discord.py (``python -m pip install -U discord.py``)  
Once you did this, fill the informations in info.json, and you're good to go! just run the bot and see who is online with !online
